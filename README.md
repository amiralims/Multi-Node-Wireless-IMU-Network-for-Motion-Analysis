# Multi-Node-Wireless-IMU-Network-for-Motion-Analysis
This repository contains the complete hardware, firmware, and software for a custom-built, end-to-end system for capturing real-time motion data from multiple wireless sensor nodes. The system was originally developed to explore the use of wearable MEMS sensor data in the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.
